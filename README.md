# guifontzoom.vim

This is not my code. I simply moved a few things around and made this repository
so I could easily install [a gist (called
gtkfont.vim)](https://gist.github.com/4101252) created by github user
[menski](https://github.com/menski).

## Purpose

Easily zoom in or zoom out (i.e. increase and decrease guifont size with gvim).
Currently, this plugin only works with GTK.

## Installation

Use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) or
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
